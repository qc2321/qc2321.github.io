This week I implemented the structural integrity score on clusters generated by a Gaussian Mixture Model, and was able to ascribe a higher score to tight clusters than to wide clusters, and a higher score to means that are farther apart. While this provides an independent loss value for the structural integrity of the transformed data, I was stuck trying to combine it with the distance loss to form a differentiable loss function. Instead of using library functions for metric learning, I will try to write an algorithm that incorporates both the distance loss and the structure integrity and is differentiable by the transformation matrix.

On the second project, I read the papers on Word2Vec and looked into applying contrastive loss to computer vision data. In the coming week, I intend to familiarize myself with the ImageNet dataset and find a way to apply the contrastive loss model.

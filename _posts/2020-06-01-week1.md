I had my kick-off meeting with Professor Verma on May 10 to discuss the scope of my research project, which involves an exploration of a metric learning algorithm that separates data in pre-defined clusters, but retains the structural integrity (to be defined) of each cluster. Since I have little knowledge in metric learning, Professor Verma suggested that I read the Mahalanobic Metric for Clustering (Xing et al., 2002) and Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (Weinberger and Saul, 2009) papers to get a sense for some of the existing methodologies. The learning curve is steep as there is a fair amount of background knowledge I needed to acquire (via Wikipedia and Google search!) before I could understand the technical details of the papers, but I very much enjoyed the process!

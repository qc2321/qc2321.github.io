This week I met with Professor Verma to discuss the design of the structural integrity score that can accommodate Gaussian clusters as well as data that forms concentric circles. I proposed using Spectral Clustering and Silhouette Coefficient to measure structural integrity, 

challenges of designing a structural integrity score that is differentiable and can be incorporated into the overall metric learning loss function.

title: Week 12

This week I met with Professor Verma to discuss the design of the structural integrity score that can accommodate Gaussian clusters as well as data that forms concentric circles. I proposed using Spectral Clustering and Silhouette Coefficient to measure structural integrity, and was able to produce scores that are largely consistent with what visually appears to be correct. However, by calling the Spectral Clustering function in calculating the structural integrity score, we have made the loss function non-differentiable.

The task for the coming week is to produce a simple structural integrity score that is differentiable, even if it is only accurate for a small subset of data.

This week I met with Professor Verma to review my formulation of the structural integrity score. He pointed out two errors with my formula: 1) Since it assigns a higher score to clusters means that are farther apart, it does not distinguish concentric clusters with different radii. 2) My use of the determinant of the covariance matrix does not accurately reflect true spread of a cluster. Since the formula assigns a lower score to a cluster whose covariance matrix has a greater determinant, it would incorrectly assign a high score to a cluster that has no variance in one dimension and a large variance in another.

In the coming week, I will incorporate the feedback and revise the structural integrity formulation accordingly.

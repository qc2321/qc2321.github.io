title: Week 14

This week I met with Professor Verma to discuss the implementation of the MMC algorithm. I had worked on it over the past week but was stuck on implementing the objective function with its hard constraints. Professor Verma suggested that I changed one of the constraints to a soft constraint, which allows me to change the objective function into a Lagrangian and perform gradient descent. I will plan to code up the simplified MMC before attempting to incorporate the hard constraints.

In addition to the SPML research project, Professor Verma suggested that I select two unrelated research papers to review and discuss for our next meeting.

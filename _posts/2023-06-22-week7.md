I spent the past week working on the nonparametric regression problem assigned by Professor Verma, and gained a better understanding in multivariate Gaussians and the effect of using kernel functions to define covariance matrices. I was stuck on the part where I had to generate a periodic posterior function, as I could not produce a positive semidefinite covariance matrix.

I have also started to implement the Gaussian Mixture Model on the main research project, and hope to have an operational model by next week.

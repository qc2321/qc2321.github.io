## About Me

I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Columbia University through the MS Bridge Program, with an expected graduation date of May 2024. Prior to Columbia, I had spent over 20 years in the healthcare and financial services industries as an operator and an investor. I received a Bachelor of Arts in Classics from Harvard University in 1999 and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2005.  Born and raised in Hong Kong, I currently live in New York City with my wife Hannah and two sons Miles and Oliver.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Columbia University through the MS Bridge Program, with an expected graduation date of May 2024. Prior to Columbia, I served as President and CFO at TrialSpark, a technology-driven drug development platform operating end-to-end clinical trials for biopharma and the life sciences industry.  Prior to TrialSpark, I served as Chief Financial Officer at CityMD, the leading urgent care operator in the New York metro area that served over 2 million patients across 110+ clinics.  Before entering a career as an operator, Quentin spent 12 years at Crestview Partners, a New York-based private equity firm with over $7 billion under management, as a Partner leading the firm's healthcare, financial services and business services practices.  Quentin started his career at Goldman Sachs and The Carlyle Group, and received his Bachelor of Arts in Classics from Harvard University (1999) and his MBA from Harvard Business School (2005).  Quentin was born and raised in Hong Kong, and currently lives in New York City with his wife and two sons.
